        Hello and welcome to my website!
        This is a blog site where I leave
        reveiws on my favorite books, and information
        about things I have been crocheting lately,
        including links to my favorite patterns,
        pictures of things I have made, and my opinions
        on different types of yarn.

          If you don't agree with me on the core principles
        of this site, or think my ideas are stupid, feel
        free to leave the site right now. I don't want
        you to be bored.
        This is just a quick demo site before I actually
        manage to turn it into a blog.
